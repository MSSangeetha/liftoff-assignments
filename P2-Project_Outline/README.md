## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I love cooking and always write my recipes in a note book.  When I thought about my project plan for launchcode, the first think came to my mind was to create a website to save my recipes.  On a high level, I am planning to have a website to view all the recipes, add a new recipe, search for a recipe. I believe this kind of app will be useful to anybody to store the recipes they like.

### Features
The Features in this website would be,
- User Login -> New User can register and create an account.
- View All -> View all the Recipes
- Search -> Search for a recipe with a keyword
- Add -> Add a new recipe

### Technologies
Technologies to be used,
- Java
- SpringBoot
- MySql
- Thymeleaf Templates
- Hibernate

### What I'll Have to Learn
I think this project is going to be challenging and I will have more chances to learn something new.
I really love web designing and thinking to make the page look appealing by adding css and images.
